# SignalNote v1 Ship Log

## Date
December 2024

## Problem Summary
Magic link sign-in was timing out in production due to:
- Incorrect auth callback implementation using client-side hash fragments instead of server-side code exchange
- Missing middleware for session refresh on protected routes
- Login page using environment variables that could cause host mismatches
- Auth callback implemented as a page component instead of a route handler

## Fix Summary
- Centralized Supabase client creation using @supabase/ssr package
- Replaced client-side auth callback with proper server-side route handler using exchangeCodeForSession
- Created middleware to refresh session cookies on /app routes only
- Updated login page to check for existing sessions and auto-redirect to /app
- Created minimal protected page at /app showing logged-in user email with logout functionality
- Added /app/demo page for feedback analysis with CSV export
- Created /api/analyze endpoint with OpenAI integration and deterministic fallback
- Added Node.js runtime specification to all auth-related files
- Used window.location.origin for redirects to avoid host mismatches

## Next Tiny Step
Test magic link authentication on production domain and verify protected routes load correctly.

## Environment Variables Required
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` - Supabase project URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Supabase anonymous key  
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Optional, for enhanced analysis (has fallback)

## Supabase Settings Required
- Site URL: https://signalnote.vercel.app
- Additional redirect URLs: https://signalnote.vercel.app/auth/callback
- Email magic link provider enabled
