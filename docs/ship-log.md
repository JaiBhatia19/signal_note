# SignalNote v1 Ship Log

## Date
December 2024

## Problem Summary
Magic link sign-in was timing out in production due to:
- Incorrect auth callback implementation using client-side hash fragments instead of server-side code exchange
- Missing middleware for session refresh on protected routes
- Login page using `window.location.origin` which doesn't work properly in production
- Auth callback implemented as a page component instead of a route handler

## Fix Summary
- Replaced client-side auth callback with proper server-side route handler using `exchangeCodeForSession`
- Created middleware to refresh session cookies on all protected routes
- Updated login page to use `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` environment variable for redirects
- Created minimal protected page at `/app` showing logged-in user email
- Added Node.js 20.x engine requirement to package.json
- Fixed auth callback to redirect to `/dashboard` after successful authentication

## Next Tiny Step
Test magic link authentication on production domain and verify protected routes load correctly.

## Environment Variables Required
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` - Supabase project URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Supabase anonymous key

## Supabase Settings Required
