# LinkedIn Post Draft: SignalNote v1 Launch

## ðŸš€ **Just shipped SignalNote v1 - My first full-stack SaaS!**

**What it is:** An AI-powered customer feedback analysis tool that turns raw feedback into actionable insights with sentiment analysis, urgency detection, and theme discovery.

**Tech Stack:**
- Next.js 14 + App Router
- TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth)
- OpenAI GPT-4o-mini integration
- Vercel deployment

**Key Features:**
âœ… CSV upload & validation
âœ… AI-powered sentiment analysis (0-100 scale)
âœ… Urgency detection (low/medium/high)
âœ… Theme discovery with example quotes
âœ… Export to CSV functionality
âœ… Magic link authentication
âœ… Demo mode for testing

**What I learned building this:**
1. **Environment variable management** - The hard way! CI failures taught me to never use dummy env vars
2. **Next.js App Router** - Server vs Client components are tricky but powerful
3. **Database design** - Row-level security with Supabase is game-changing
4. **AI integration** - Fallback systems are crucial when APIs fail
5. **Deployment** - Vercel makes it easy, but environment setup is everything

**The journey:**
- Started with a simple idea: "What if analyzing customer feedback wasn't painful?"
- Built MVP in 2 weeks
- Faced CI/CD hell (those GitHub Action emails were brutal!)
- Finally got it deployed and working
- Now ready for real users!

Building in public is hard but rewarding. Every failure teaches you something new. 

What's your experience with building SaaS products? Any tips for a first-time founder?
