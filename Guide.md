# SignalNote Implementation Guide

This guide contains the essential templates and specifications for implementing the SignalNote MVP.

## ðŸ¤– AI Analysis Prompt Templates

### 1. Feedback Analysis Prompt

The main prompt used in `src/lib/openai.ts` for analyzing customer feedback:

```typescript
const ANALYSIS_PROMPT = `You are an expert product manager analyzing customer feedback. Analyze the following feedback and provide a structured response.

Feedback: "{text}"

Provide your analysis in the following JSON format:
{
  "sentiment": 0.0-1.0, // 0 = very negative, 1 = very positive
  "urgency": 0.0-1.0,   // 0 = not urgent, 1 = extremely urgent
  "business_impact": 1-5, // 1 = low impact, 5 = critical impact
  "insights": [
    "Key insight 1",
    "Key insight 2", 
    "Key insight 3"
  ],
  "summary": "Brief summary of the feedback and its implications"
}

Guidelines:
- Sentiment: Consider tone, emotion, and overall satisfaction
- Urgency: Assess how quickly this needs attention
- Business Impact: Evaluate potential effect on business goals
- Insights: Extract 1-3 actionable insights
- Summary: 1-2 sentence summary for stakeholders

Be objective and business-focused in your analysis.`;
```

### 2. Cluster Label Generation

Used in `src/lib/clustering.ts` for generating meaningful cluster labels:

```typescript
const CLUSTER_LABEL_PROMPT = `Analyze these feedback items and generate a concise, business-focused label:

Feedback items:
{feedbackItems}

Generate a label that:
- Is 2-4 words maximum
- Describes the main theme or issue
- Uses business terminology
- Is actionable for product teams

Examples: "Performance Issues", "Feature Requests", "UX Problems", "Mobile Crashes"

Label:`;
```

### 3. Feature Request Generation

For converting clusters into actionable feature requests:

```typescript
const FEATURE_REQUEST_PROMPT = `Based on this cluster of feedback, generate a specific feature request:

Cluster: {clusterLabel}
Feedback count: {count}
Average sentiment: {avgSentiment}
Average urgency: {avgUrgency}

Generate a feature request that:
- Addresses the main pain point
- Is specific and implementable
- Includes business justification
- Suggests priority level

Feature Request:`;
```

### 4. Action Items Generation

For creating actionable next steps from clusters:

```typescript
const ACTION_ITEMS_PROMPT = `Based on this feedback cluster, suggest 2-3 specific action items:

Cluster: {clusterLabel}
Feedback: {feedbackItems}

Generate action items that are:
- Specific and measurable
- Prioritized by impact
- Assignable to teams
- Time-bound where possible

Action Items:`;
```

## ðŸ“Š CSV Upload Specification

### Required Columns

The CSV upload feature expects these exact column headers:

```csv

```

### Column Definitions

| `product_area` | string | Yes | Product feature area | `dashboard`, `search`, `mobile`, `reporting`, `ui`, `api`, `integrations` |
| `text` | string | Yes | The feedback content | Any text describing the feedback |
| `created_at` | string | Yes | When feedback was received | `2024-01-15T10:30:00Z` or `2024-01-15` |

### CSV Format Requirements

- **Encoding**: UTF-8
- **Delimiter**: Comma (,)
- **Quote Character**: Double quotes (")
- **Date Format**: ISO 8601 preferred, but flexible
- **File Size**: Maximum 10MB
- **Row Limit**: Maximum 1000 rows per upload

### Sample CSV File

twitter,pro,ui,"Please add dark mode theme",2024-01-15T18:30:00Z
```

### Validation Rules

```typescript
// Validation logic from src/app/api/feedback/batch/route.ts
const validateCSV = (records: any[]) => {
  const requiredColumns = ['source', 'user_segment', 'product_area', 'text', 'created_at'];
  
  // Check required columns exist
  const headers = Object.keys(records[0] || {});
  const missingColumns = requiredColumns.filter(col => !headers.includes(col));
  
  if (missingColumns.length > 0) {
    throw new Error(`Missing required columns: ${missingColumns.join(', ')}`);
  }
  
  // Validate each row
  records.forEach((record, index) => {
    if (!record.text || record.text.trim().length === 0) {
      throw new Error(`Row ${index + 1}: text is required`);
    }
    
    if (!record.source || !record.user_segment || !record.product_area) {
      throw new Error(`Row ${index + 1}: source, user_segment, and product_area are required`);
    }
  });
};
```
