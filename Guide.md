# **The Idea (from live gaps \+ forums pain points)**

üîç Topic ‚Äì "Internal User Feedback & Workflow Tissue Builder"  
A lightweight, AI‚Äëpowered "feedback \+ workflow memory" tool for small teams who constantly lose user/customer/internal context across Slack, Notion, email, JIRA, etc.

üìå Pain Point (from Reddit/HN in last 30 days):

* Startups and small teams complain about customer interviews going into the void. Founders collect tons of user feedback, but it gets messy‚Äîstuck across docs, Slack, Notion, and never drives product.  
* Product managers: ‚ÄúI have 100s of user interview notes but no *signal extraction*. I can‚Äôt keep track of what was said, by whom, and whether we actually acted on it.‚Äù  
* Engineers: ‚ÄúWe often re‚Äëask customers the same questions because notes are lost. Feels amateur.‚Äù

üí° Solution:  
An AI‚Äëpowered *Feedback OS* that plugs into where founders already live (Slack, Notion, Google Docs, Linear/JIRA) ‚Üí automatically ingests customer calls/feedback ‚Üí makes it searchable, clusters insights (e.g. ‚Äú5 users want SSO, 3 users hated onboarding step 2‚Äù), and tracks which product decisions addressed those requests.

Target User:

* Early‚Äëstage founders, product managers, customer success leads.  
* They *will pay* $100/mo because it saves them time, pain, and keeps investors off their back (‚Äúshow me your customer discovery record‚Äù).

Why this works üöÄ:

* You don‚Äôt compete with Jira/Notion: you‚Äôre just the tissue \+ intelligence layer.  
* Perfect YC wedge: every founder is told ‚Äútalk to your users,‚Äù but nobody has a good ‚Äúcustomer discovery brain.‚Äù

---

## **üìö The Blueprint / Playbook (YC style)**

## **Phase 0 ‚Äî Nail the Pain**

* Checkpoint: Do 15 founder/product manager interviews ‚Üí ask how they track user feedback today.  
* Goal ‚Üí get 3 of them to *pre‚Äëcommit $50‚Äì100/mo* for your MVP.

---

## **Phase 1 ‚Äî MVP (Vibe Code Mode)**

Scope:

* Input: Slack/Notion/Email/manual paste.  
* Output: Searchable database of feedback \+ automatic clustering (similar feedback grouped).  
* Bonus: Generate ‚Äúcompany memory‚Äù style reports (‚ÄúTop 5 pains this week‚Äù).

Tools:

* Cursor (AI pair‚Äëprogramming) ‚Üí actual codebase.  
* GPT‚Äë4 (prompt engineer \+ summarizer) ‚Üí BRD writing, customer research automation, clustering prototype.  
* Supabase (auth \+ db \+ storage).  
* Next.js (frontend).  
* LangChain/LlamaIndex or direct OpenAI API calls for summarization & embeddings ‚Üí search.  
* Railway/Render ‚Üí cheap hosting.

Checkpoint:

* 5 paying teams ($100/mo each). Don‚Äôt scale infra yet.

---

## **Phase 2 ‚Äî First 100 Users ($10k MRR path)**

* Add integrations: Zoom transcripts, Google Meet, Linear.  
* Build *customer request tracking pipeline* ‚Üí each feature request tagged ‚Üí status visible (open / shipped / rejected).  
* Add Slack bot (direct command: ‚Äúwhat has 5+ customer requests right now?‚Äù).

Community Strategy:

* Cold email/DM YC/OnDeck/Indie founders.  
* Drop into Twitter/X startup convos (‚Äúhow do you track feedback?‚Äù).  
* Offer free migration for their messy Notion docs in exchange for being case study users.

Checkpoint: 100 paying teams at $100/mo \= $10k MRR.

---

## **Phase 3 ‚Äî Growth & Network Effects**

* Add multi‚Äëtenant dashboard for investors/accelerators: ‚Äúportfolio company user insights across startups.‚Äù (VCs pay for this).  
* Viral loop: when a customer success manager invites product/engineering into the system.

Checkpoint: $50‚Äì100k MRR ‚Üí consider seed round if scale ambition.

---

## **üß© Tech/Execution Stack Cheat‚ÄëSheet for Solo Founder**

* ChatGPT:  
  * BRD (business requirements doc), customer call analysis, UX copy, clustering experiments.  
* Cursor: Core coding (Next.js \+ Supabase \+ API wiring).  
* Supabase: Auth, DB, storage for transcripts/feedback.  
* Postgres \+ pgvector: Store embeddings for feedback search.  
* OpenAI Embeddings \+ GPT-4-turbo: Summaries, clustering, insights extraction.  
* Vercel/Render: Deploy frontend/backend quickly.  
* Zapier/n8n/Typefully: Growth hacks \+ distribution automation.

---

## **üöÄ The YC Execution Mindset**

* Don‚Äôt build for months. Build something janky that ingests feedback ‚Üí search page ‚Üí clusters. Show to your first 3 users this week.  
* Charge from day 1\. $100/mo validates serious need.  
* Talk to every single customer weekly. Make this your unfair advantage.  
* Retention \> Growth. The moment your 10 users say ‚Äúthis saves me from drowning in notes,‚Äù you‚Äôre onto something.  
* Your angle vs Notion/Airtable? You are *opinionated*, designed for customer discovery and product signal‚Äînot generic notes.

# **Vision & Milestones**

## **Vision:** 

Build the ‚ÄúCustomer Memory OS‚Äù for startups. A system that never forgets what users say, clusters feedback into signal, and connects to product decisions.

## **Templates:**

## **1\. Supabase Schema Draft (SQL)**

## \-- \-------------------------------

\-- Supabase Schema for EchoOS MVP  
\-- \-------------------------------

\-- 1\. Users Table (Managed by Supabase auth, no need to create here)

\-- 2\. Feedback Table  
CREATE TABLE feedback (  
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen\_random\_uuid(),  
  user\_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),  \-- Links feedback to signed-in user  
  source TEXT,        \-- E.g., 'Slack', 'Zoom', 'Manual' input source of feedback  
  content TEXT,       \-- Full raw text of the feedback  
  created\_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()  \-- Timestamp when feedback was added  
);

\-- Add vector embedding column (for semantic search with pgvector)  
ALTER TABLE feedback ADD COLUMN embedding vector(1536);

\-- 3\. Feature Requests Table (Tracks aggregated feedback turned into product features)  
CREATE TABLE feature\_requests (  
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen\_random\_uuid(),  
  title TEXT NOT NULL,                  \-- Brief descriptive title of feature request  
  description TEXT,                    \-- Extended notes about feature request  
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'open',          \-- 'open', 'in\_progress', 'shipped' states  
  created\_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW() \-- When feature request was created  
);

\-- 4\. Feedback to Feature Link (Many-to-many)  
CREATE TABLE feedback\_feature\_link (  
  feedback\_id UUID REFERENCES feedback(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,  
  feature\_request\_id UUID REFERENCES feature\_requests(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,  
  PRIMARY KEY (feedback\_id, feature\_request\_id)  
);

\-- Index on embedding vector for efficient similarity search  
CREATE INDEX ON feedback USING ivfflat (embedding vector\_cosine\_ops) WITH (lists \= 100);

## **2\. Sample Seed Data (SQL)**

\-- Replace 'user-uuid-x' with actual user IDs after sign-up

INSERT INTO feedback (user\_id, source, content) VALUES  
('user-uuid-1', 'Slack', 'Customer mentioned onboarding flow is confusing.'),  
('user-uuid-2', 'Zoom', 'Request for adding single sign-on support.'),  
('user-uuid-3', 'Manual', 'Several users complained about dashboard taking too long to load.');

INSERT INTO feature\_requests (title, description, status) VALUES  
('Improve Onboarding Flow', 'Simplify onboarding process due to customer confusion.', 'open'),  
('Add Single Sign-On (SSO)', 'Support Google and Microsoft login for easier access.', 'open');

INSERT INTO feedback\_feature\_link (feedback\_id, feature\_request\_id) VALUES  
((SELECT id FROM feedback WHERE content LIKE '%onboarding%'), (SELECT id FROM feature\_requests WHERE title LIKE '%Onboarding%')),  
((SELECT id FROM feedback WHERE content LIKE '%single sign-on%'), (SELECT id FROM feature\_requests WHERE title LIKE '%SSO%'));

## **3\. GPT Clustering Prompt Template**

You are an AI assistant tasked with grouping similar user feedback into clusters by theme. 

Here are feedback items:

1\. "Customers find the onboarding process confusing and too long."  
2\. "Many users want single sign-on for easier login."  
3\. "Dashboard loading speed is slow and frustrating."  
4\. "Onboarding screens have unclear instructions."  
5\. "People requested support for login with Google."

Group these feedbacks into 2‚Äì3 clusters with a short title and list the included feedback. Example:

Cluster 1: Onboarding Issues  
 \- Customers find the onboarding process confusing and too long.  
 \- Onboarding screens have unclear instructions.

Cluster 2: Authentication Requests  
 \- Many users want single sign-on for easier login.  
 \- People requested support for login with Google.

Cluster 3: Performance  
 \- Dashboard loading speed is slow and frustrating.

## **4\. Search Prompt Template for Semantic Search**

You are a search assistant. Given user query: "{search\_query}" and feedback snippets, rank the most relevant feedback entries and provide a summary of the most critical points.

Feedback snippets:  
\- "{feedback\_1}"  
\- "{feedback\_2}"  
\- "{feedback\_3}"  
...

## **5\. UI Copy Snippets (Place under ‚ÄúScreen Copy‚Äù heading)**

* Login Screen:  
  * ‚ÄúWelcome back\! Please log in to continue.‚Äù  
  * Button: ‚ÄúLog In‚Äù  
  * Link: ‚ÄúNeed an account? Sign up‚Äù  
* Add Feedback Screen:  
  * Header: ‚ÄúAdd Customer Feedback‚Äù  
  * Placeholder: ‚ÄúPaste Zoom transcript, Slack message, or notes here...‚Äù  
  * Button: ‚ÄúUpload & Analyze‚Äù  
* Search Screen:  
  * Placeholder: ‚ÄúSearch feedback for keywords or themes...‚Äù  
  * No results: ‚ÄúNo feedback matches your query yet.‚Äù  
* Insights Screen:  
  * Header: ‚ÄúTop Pain Points & Requests‚Äù  
  * Button: ‚ÄúMark as Tracked‚Äù  
  * Empty state: ‚ÄúNo clusters found. Add some feedback to get started.‚Äù  
* Dashboard:  
  * Header: ‚ÄúFeature Requests Tracker‚Äù  
  * Status tags: ‚ÄúOpen,‚Äù ‚ÄúIn Progress,‚Äù ‚ÄúShipped‚Äù
